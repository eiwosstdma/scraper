> DOCUMENTATION IS NOT FULLY WRITTEN YET

### Install it
```powershell
  npm i mtg-scrapper
```
### How to start with it
You can « custom » your experience with it by just importing functions you need. Though,
you may want to start quickly with it, and you need just big output of data without the need
of granularity.

To get data of the current day, just do that;
```typescript
import { dataOfTheDay } from 'mtg-scrapper';

/**
 * You can give a configuration to specify formats and type of events,
 * By default, everything competitive mtgo format & events are scraped.
 */

const bulk = await dataOfTheDay();
```
The data is an array containing the metadata of each tournament and deck lists of the tournament.


## API DOCUMENTATION
<p>
  All functions are described with interfaces.
</p>

### Filters
```typescript
/**
 * Compare a instance of Deck against a given filter 
 * and output either the name for the deck if the filter do apply or null.
 */
interface filtering {
  (deck: IDeck, filter: IFilter): IFilter['name'] | null;
}
```

### Link Generators - MTGO (Probably will be the same API for other websites)
```typescript
/**
 * Create links without checking them, 
 * for a given configuration and a number of days.
 * It will cumulates tournaments within the array, 
 * starting from the current day through the number of days you specified.
 */
interface linkGenerator{
  (days: number, configuration?: IConfigurationLinker): Array<string>;
}
```
```typescript
/**
 * Create links without checking them, 
 * for a given configuration and a day in milmiseconds.
 * It does not cumulate the result if you specify and old day, 
 * but generate only links for the day.
 */
interface generateLinksFrom {
  (dayToScrap: number, configuration?: IConfigurationLinker): Array<string>;
}
```
```typescript
/**
 * Check if the link you give is a valid tournament link, 
 * it will await the time you've given in arguments if needed, 
 * if you have ton of links to check, 
 * it's better to make it await at least a second for each linl,
 * to not flood the given website.
 */
interface checkLink {
  (link: string, awaitFor?: number): Promise<string | null>
}
```
```typescript
/**
 * The same thing that checkLink but check a big array, 
 * return good links and null for links that are not valid.
 */
interface checkArrayOfLinks {
  (links: Array<stirng>, awaitFor?: number): Promise<Array<string | null>>;
}
```
